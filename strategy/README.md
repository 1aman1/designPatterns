Sorting Algorithms: The Strategy pattern is commonly used in scenarios where different sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort) need to be employed based on different criteria or preferences. By encapsulating each sorting algorithm as a separate strategy, the client code can dynamically switch between strategies at runtime, allowing for flexible and interchangeable sorting behavior.

File Compression: When implementing file compression or decompression algorithms, the Strategy pattern can be utilized to handle different compression algorithms (e.g., ZIP, GZIP, RAR). Each compression algorithm can be encapsulated as a strategy, and the appropriate strategy can be selected based on the user's preference or the file type being processed.
