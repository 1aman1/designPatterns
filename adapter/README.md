Legacy System Integration: When integrating new systems with existing legacy systems, the Adapter pattern can be used to bridge the gap between their different interfaces. Instead of modifying the legacy code, you can create adapters that wrap around the legacy components and adapt their interfaces to match the expectations of the new systems.

Third-Party API Integration: When working with third-party APIs that have different interfaces from your application, the Adapter pattern can be useful. You can create adapters that convert the methods and data of the third-party API into a format that your application expects, making it easier to integrate and interact with the API.

Reusable Components: The Adapter pattern can be used to create reusable components that adapt different interfaces to a common interface. By providing adapters for various classes or systems, you can make them interchangeable with other components that rely on the common interface. This promotes modularity and flexibility in the codebase.
