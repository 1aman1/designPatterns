/* The IProduct class defines the abstract product interface, which includes the qcCheck() method.

The IProduct interface is implemented by the ConcreteProductA class, which represents a specific concrete product.

The IFactory class defines the abstract factory interface, which includes the makeProduct() method responsible for creating the product.

The ConcreteFactoryA class implements the IFactory interface and provides the implementation for creating a specific product (ConcreteProductA) using the makeProduct() method.

In the main() function, a factory object (ConcreteFactoryA) is created, and the factory's makeProduct() method is used to create a product (ConcreteProductA).

The created product is then used by calling its qcCheck() method.

IT ENCAPSULATES THE PRODUCT CREATION LOGIC WITHIN THE FACTORY CLASS, ALLOWING THE CLIENT CODE TO CREATE PRODUCTS WITHOUT KNOWING THE SPECIFIC CONCRETE CLASS.
